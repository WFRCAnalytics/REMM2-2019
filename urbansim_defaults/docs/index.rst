Introduction
=================

This module wraps UrbanSim in a way which allows configuration of models in YAML which is suitable for use in the UrbanSim website.  This is primarily documentation for the `utils.py` module which wraps UrbanSim in a slightly higher level of abstraction.  UrbanSim defaults also includes default models, columns, and datasources, which are not currently documented in any depth.
